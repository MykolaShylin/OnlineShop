Code First approach is used when working with the database;

A separate API with connection via HttpClient is developed for working with product reviews;
There was developed a Telegram chat-bot using RabbitMQ for user interaction with the site through the bot, but in the working version it did not get as to maintain it in working condition requires a paid service.
